I am currently a PhD student at University of British Columbia, and my supervisor is Prof.Giuseppe Carenini. I finished my Master at University of British Columbia with Prof. Giuseppe Carenini in 2019, and I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto in 2017. 

My research interest is Automatic Summarization and Discourse Parsing.


Outside of work, I like traveling, dancing (beginner) and watching movies and shows.
